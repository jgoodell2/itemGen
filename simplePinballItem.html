You are designing a rudimentary pinball machine and trying to find the perfect spring for your machine. The spring initially rests at s_0 = 4 \mathrm{m}. You want to use an antique pinball that you found that has a mass m = 1.05 \mathrm{kg}.  Based on your design, you know that the angle of your playfield will be \theta = 15\degree, your pinball needs to have a final ejected velocity of v = 1.8 \mathrm{m/s}, and it needs to travel d = 2.2\mathrm{m} in order to enter the playing field properly. For simplicity, assume the pinball is not rolling and just sliding on the smooth field without friction. What does your spring constant need to be if you only have enough room for the spring to be compressed to a length of s = 1.4 \mathrm{m}? Round your answer to 2 decimal places.
