This project will develop a method for specifying, autogeneration, automation, and interoperability of **adaptive OER assessment items**. It will also develop sample code demostrating the portability of these items across delivery platforms and contexts.

Definitions:
* **method for specifying** -- The project will develop an item profile specification format, a means of specifying the type of stimulus and possible learner responses during interaction with an assessment item. Each item profile specification using this format will serve as a template for autogeneration of any number of psycometrically comparable items.
* **autogeneration** -- The project aims to demonsrate (with working code) a method for autogenteratiin of OER assessment items.
* **interoperability** -- The assessment items gernerated should be interoperable with (1) common end user delivery platforms including presentation of items via standard web browsers and (2) collection of data from item interactions using data instrumentation standards. A secondary goal is addressing use with and within content management and learning management platforms from which the content may be acessed or launched.
* **OER** -- The intent of this project is to support the proliferation of interoperable assessment items as widley available open education resources.
